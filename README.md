# MKS: Mouse Click Sounds

Do you love satisfying click sounds when using your mouse? Are you tired of the silent, lifeless clicking of modern mice that provide no audio feedback? Well, you are in luck! I have a program that will bring back that wonderful clicking sound you love so much. It's called Mouse Click Sounds, or MKS for short.

This project is a fork of the original MKS (Mechanical Keyboard Simulator) that has been refocused specifically on providing satisfying mouse click sounds. While the original was designed to simulate mechanical keyboard sounds, this version concentrates on enhancing your mouse clicking experience.

The clicking sound serves as audio feedback - a reassurance that your clicks are being registered. On modern mice, especially touchpads and silent mice, there's often little to no audio feedback, making it harder to know if your clicks were successful. This app fills that gap by providing customizable click sounds.

Here are the special features of this system-wide Mouse Click Sounds simulator:

1. Adjustable Volume as a percentage of the system volume setting.
2. Separate mouse down and mouse up sounds to increase realism.
3. Multiple Sound Profiles with different click sounds.
4. Stereo and Mono Sound Profile support.
5. Randomized pitch for more natural variation.
6. Easy toggle to enable/disable mouse effects.
7. Customizable stereo width for spatial audio experience.

Give it a try, see what you think. I think you are going to love the enhanced feedback, and since it works with headphones too, you can enjoy satisfying clicks without disturbing others. :)
